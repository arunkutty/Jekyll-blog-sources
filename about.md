My name is Arun N. Kutty and I am a Software Developer and problem solver (Level-3 support) working on the area of Test Automation
and Performance Testing in IBM Cloud. Apart from Test Automation and Performance Testing which gives me my bread and butter,
I am interested in Web and Mobile applications and tinker away merrily during weekends and holidays on my personal time.

Apart from Software and Family, Music and Reading takes up most of my time. I dabble with sketching and playing the keyboard as well.
The quintessential jack of all trades, so to speak.

I try to derive meaning in life by setting goals and working towards achieving them. My wife, I and our 2 boys live a content life
among a circle of good friends in CV Raman Nagar, Bangalore.
